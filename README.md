# Custom anti-debugging
Custom anti-debugging yet very simple.

Due to its utilization in a private project, the source code will not be made available for release. However, considering the available video and information, emulating and coding it yourself should not pose a significant challenge.

The video doesn't demonstrate this feature, but according to the configurations, if the user has enabled "bcdedit /debug," the process will automatically terminate itself. It can also terminate itself if it detects any blacklisted processes, rather than terminating those specific processes.
